Welcome to "Learn the Unix Command Line Basics" by Firestorm!

This will teach you basic commands in a fun and engaging way.

Let's learn our first command. "cd", abbreviating change directory. You use the cd command to change the path that you are in. 
For example, there is a folder called step1. 

Open up your MacOS or Linux terminal, and run
"cd step1".

Now, run "ls". This command will list the files in the directory (which is step1 in this case).

See anything? You can use the "cat" command to read the file you see. For example, "cat example1.txt".
