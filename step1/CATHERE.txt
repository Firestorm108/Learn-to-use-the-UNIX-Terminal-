You made it!

Good job. You learned how to:

cd- into directories
ls- list files
cat- read files

Some other commands you may need to know are:
rm- removes file
mv- moves a file
cp- copies a file
mkdir- makes a folder
pwd- print working directory



Practice the commands with the various folders which I have provided in the parent folder.  Run "cd .." to go to the parent directory.
